# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

The Amazon Vine Program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. This analysis is to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members compared to non-Vine members. The dataset selected for this analysis is the Apparel dataset. This analysis was reviewed, filtered and transformed using PySpark, AWS RDS, and PostgreSQL.
